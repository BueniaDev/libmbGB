# Notes

This project was originally created back in 2018 (and originally rewritten back in 2019), when I was originally a high-school student. However, in order to modernize and improve the codebase, it is currently being rewritten (again) at this moment. If you want to checkout the project from before this rewrite, checkout the current main branch.
